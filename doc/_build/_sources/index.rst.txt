**inverse** - A high-level M/EEG Python library for EEG inverse solutions
======

Welcome to the documentation of the inverse package for python! You can find the
documentation of **over 40** inverse solutions here: :doc:`content/solvers`. In
the future, there will be some tutorials.

Installation
============

You can simply install the package using pip:

..  code-block::
    
    pip install inverse

Quickstart
==========

Given that you have a mne.Forward model and some mne.Evoked data, you can simply
calculate an inverse solution as such:

..  code-block:: python
    
    # import
    from inverse import Solver
    
    # create a solver instance
    solver = Solver("MNE")

    # Make an inverse operator
    solver.make_inverse_operator(forward)

    # Apply the inverse operator
    stc = solver.apply_inverse_operator(evoked)

    # Plot the result
    stc.plot()
