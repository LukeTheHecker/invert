**invertmeeg** - A high-level M/EEG Python library for EEG inverse solutions
======

Welcome to the documentation of the invertmeeg package for python! You can find
the documentation of **over 50** inverse solutions here: :doc:`content/solvers`.
In the future, there will be some tutorials.

Installation
============

You can simply install the package using pip:

..  code-block::
    
    pip install invertmeeg

Quickstart
==========

Given that you have a mne.Forward model and some mne.Evoked data, you can simply
calculate an inverse solution as such:

..  code-block:: python
    
    # fwd = ...
    # evoked = ...

    # Create a Solver instance
    solver_name = "MNE"
    solver = Solver(solver_name)

    # Calculate the inverse operator
    solver.make_inverse_operator(fwd)

    # Apply the inverse operator to your data
    stc = solver.apply_inverse_operator(evoked)

    # Plot the resulting source estimate
    stc.plot()

There are many solvers implemented in the package. You can find them in the
:doc:`content/solvers` page and the :doc:`content/gallery`! Check out our
:doc:`content/tutorial` for a more comprehensive step-by-step tutorial!
