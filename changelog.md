* Many changes such as
  * added new solvers
  * added more sophisticated simulations


# 0.0.6 03.01.2022
* fixed an error in RAP- and TRAP-MUSIC resulting in a potentially erroneous extra source found
* standardized the final estimation of the current source density with all recursive MUSIC approaches
* speeding up calculations of the singular values on multiple occasions
* Added the FUN and HS Champagne inverse solutions

## 0.0.5 31.12.2022
* removed automated regularisation from sloreta due to unexpected behaviors

* added new Champagne solvers: "MacKay Champagne" and "Convexity Champagne"

## 0.0.4 30.12.2022
* Change in FLEX-MUSIC: use selected dipoles/ smooth patches as source covariance during WMNE inversion
  * before: indices were selected as full flat priors for WMNE inversion
* Fixed error with the sLORETA formula

## 0.0.3 28.12.2022
* Added rank-reduction option to invert.BaseSolver class
* Set rank_reduction as default for all Beamforming approaches for better results
