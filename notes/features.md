- implement shrinking -- focuss
- implement standardized shrinking -- focuss (SSLOFO)
- implement Adaptive standardization (ALF)
- implement beamformers
- find beamformer where correlated sources can be found
- implement MUSIC, RAP-MUSIC
- find maths/implementation for L1 norm inverse solution
- continue work on LUCAS
- implement "control" condition of CMNE paper (can be found in dinhs repo)
- implement the idea mentioned in sslofo for contextualization
- consider noise normalization for inverse solutions
- consider whitening - what is it and can it help us?
